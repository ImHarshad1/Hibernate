//Polymorphism is the Process of providing multiple implementation to a method 
//to perform some operations on the basis of parameter type or sub type... 


//There are 2 Types 
//1. Compile Time Polymorphism(Static,Early Binding) -> Handle by compiler
//2.Run Time Polymorphism(Dynamic, late Binding)     -> Handle by JVM

//Method Overloading is the example of Compile time Polymorphism
//Method Overriding is the example of Run Time Polymorphism
