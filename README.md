# 🌟 Hibernate Practice Repository

Welcome to my **Hibernate Practice Hub** — a curated collection of projects where I explore, implement, and refine **Object Relational Mapping (ORM)** concepts. This repository is my personal playground and portfolio showcase, blending clean code, Hibernate features, and interview‑ready patterns.  

Whether you're revising Hibernate for interviews or building a strong foundation in ORM, this repo is designed to be a **hands‑on reference**.

## 📂 Project Modules
Each module demonstrates a specific mapping concept with practical examples:

- **01‑One‑To‑One‑Uni** → Unidirectional One‑to‑One mapping  
- **02‑One‑To‑Many‑Uni** → Unidirectional One‑to‑Many mapping  
- **03‑Many‑To‑One‑Uni** → Unidirectional Many‑to‑One mapping  
- **04‑Many‑To‑Many‑Uni** → Unidirectional Many‑to‑Many mapping  
- **05‑One‑To‑One‑Bi** → Bidirectional One‑to‑One mapping  
- **06‑One‑To‑Many‑Bi** → Bidirectional One‑to‑Many mapping  
- **07‑Many‑To‑One‑Bi** → Bidirectional Many‑to‑One mapping  
- **08‑Many‑To‑Many‑Bi** → Bidirectional Many‑to‑Many mapping

## 🚀 Features Implemented
- 🔹 **Entity Relationships** → One‑to‑One, One‑to‑Many, Many‑to‑One, Many‑to‑Many  
- 🔹 **Unidirectional & Bidirectional mappings** with annotations  
- 🔹 **Cascade operations** for seamless persistence  
- 🔹 **Lazy & Eager fetching strategies** for performance tuning  
- 🔹 **Clean separation** of entities, configuration files, and persistence logic  
- 🔹 **Hands‑on examples** with clear folder structure for easy navigation

## 📖 Example Usages
- **One‑to‑One Uni** → Student ↔ Address mapping  
- **One‑to‑Many Bi** → Department ↔ Employees relationship  
- **Many‑to‑Many Bi** → Courses ↔ Students association

## 🛡️ Vision
This repository is more than practice — it’s a **portfolio of ORM mastery**. Each module demonstrates industry‑standard Hibernate patterns, preparing me for real‑world projects and interviews. As I add features like Lombok, advanced queries, and validations, this repo will evolve into a **complete Hibernate reference** for learners and professionals alike.
